our final project for programming EDUC 5913. We are going to create an online platform for English vocabulary practice. 

Project Overview
Vocabuddy is designed to offer a platform for English learners to practice vocabulories. It aims at fulfilling personalized learning, so it asks the users to input what they want to practice. It supports manual input, file upload, and OCR from images, offering feasibility for differnt types of inputs. And we design the practice mode following language learning, involving practice on spelling, meaning, and usage.

Users provide 10 English words, and the system generates:
A Matching Game (English ↔ Chinese)
A Scrambled-Letters Game (word unscrambling)
